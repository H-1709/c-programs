🚀 Purpose of This Repository
Strengthen C programming fundamentals

Maintain an organized archive of all my programs

Help with semester exams and GTU practicals

Build a public coding portfolio

Track personal progress

Prepare for internships and technical interviews

🧹 Clean Code Practices
.exe, build, and temporary files are ignored using a .gitignore

Only .c source code files are committed

Each topic has a dedicated folder

🔮 Future Improvements
Add comments and documentation

Add problem statements for each C file

Add screenshots of program output

Add advanced topics (dynamic memory, linked lists, file projects)
